This theme is setup to allow you to create a wp site with HTML/JS pages.

functions.php registers wp hooks and varrious other small things to make a blank install look like a site.

header/footer.php are simply backend. 

page.php renders "the content" and the graphical header and footer. 

styles.css is baseline, all extra is to be added in customizer, or seprate file, or on page. 

Any advanced php functionaity is to be build as plugins. 

This allows you to "hardcode" a wp site with minimal effort or advanced php knowlege. 

Ai is used becaues honesty lets be real its going this way. The code Ai writes is readable by anyone. And it works.
