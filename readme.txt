This is a very basic wordpress theme that allows you to build with html/css/js nativly in WP.

It gives you a header, footer, and component post to get started. 

The header, and footer components are special. they can only be single at any point in time. They are called directly from the theme header and footer templates. 

The philosiphy is that you create pages on the component level with html/css/js, any global css changes are ammended to customizer or theme file outside of stock styles.css. Any advanced functions are built as plugins. 

This was coded by an LLM under my direction, I believe this system lends itself to the use of LLM HTML/CSS/JS frontend as I have been seeing become relivent again in websites.
